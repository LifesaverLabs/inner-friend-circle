# Inner Friend

**Curate Your Closest Relationships**

Inner Friend is a relationship support and tending app that helps you intentionally nurture your closest friendships based on Dunbar's Number research. Instead of endless scrolling, invest quality time in real relationships.

*Face Time, Not Ad Time.*

## What is Dunbar's Number?

Research by anthropologist Robin Dunbar shows humans can maintain meaningful relationships at different scales:

- **Core (5)** — Your closest confidants
- **Inner (15)** — Close friends you trust deeply
- **Outer (150)** — Meaningful connections
- **Parasocial (25)** — One-sided connections (celebrities, creators)
- **Role Models (25)** — Inspiring figures
- **Acquaintances (1000)** — Peripheral contacts

## Features

- **Intentional Limits** — Science-backed caps on each tier help you focus on quality over quantity
- **Private by Default** — Your lists stay on your device; account creation is optional
- **Tending Reminders** — Get notified when you haven't contacted someone in 30+ days
- **Mutual Discovery** — Optionally discover when friends have you on their list too
- **Drag & Drop** — Easily reorder and tend to friends within tiers
- **Multiple Contact Methods** — Phone, FaceTime, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram
